Cuckoo is the leading open source automated malware analysis system. It is used to launch malware in a secure and isolated environment.
Thanks to folks at Hatching and CERT-EE, we now have a full rewrite of Cuckoo in Python 3! You can find their original setup instructions on the official Estonian CERT repo here .</description></item></channel></rss>
